# Electric Field Simulation of a Charged Sphere

A 3D visualization of the electric field generated by a uniformly charged sphere, built using **VPython**. This simulation demonstrates the electric field both inside and outside the sphere, with a moving test charge to visualize field strength and direction.

## Features
- **3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of the charged sphere and electric field vectors.
- **Test Charge Motion**: A test charge moves along predefined paths (circular, spiral, and helical) to show field behavior.
- **Field Lines**: Optional field lines to visualize the electric field direction.
- **Theoretical Comparison**: Displays both the simulated and theoretical electric field values for comparison.

## Technologies Used
- **VPython**: For 3D visualization and animation.
- **Python**: For physics calculations and logic.
